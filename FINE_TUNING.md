# Fine-Tuning gprMax AI Model with Unsloth and PyTorch

## Step 1: Install Dependencies  
- Install `unsloth`, `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, `peft`, and `accelerate`.

## Step 2: Load Pretrained Model  
- Use Unsloth to load a **lightweight, optimized** version of a transformer model.

## Step 3: Prepare Dataset  
- Load and clean the dataset from Hugging Face or a local source.

## Step 4: Tokenization  
- Apply padding and truncation to prepare data for training.

## Step 5: Apply QLoRA with PEFT  
- Use Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to reduce memory usage.

## Step 6: Define Training Arguments  
- Set batch size, epochs, learning rate, and logging parameters.

## Step 7: Train the Model  
- Fine-tune using PyTorch's `Trainer` class.

## Step 8: Evaluate Model  
- Analyze precision, recall, F1 score, and BERT score.

## Step 9: Save Fine-Tuned Model  
- Save the model and tokenizer for deployment.

## Step 10: Deploy Model  
- Deploy on Hugging Face, Streamlit Cloud, or an API.

## Step 11: Integrate with gprMax AI Chatbot  
- Use the fine-tuned model to improve chatbot responses.

## Step 12: Pipeline END



The benefits involves :

- Low VRAM Usage
- Fine Tuning is very fast
- Easy Integration with Hugging Face
- Optimized and efficient for Large Language Models
